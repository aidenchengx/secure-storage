# secure-storage
#Nowadays, cloud storage systems are becoming more and more popular. But how to achieve security as well as convenience on these systems remains a question. We will present a possible solution to this problem as following and test it on OpenStack Swift.  We deploy database server in server layer to generate and store the encryption keys. Besides, we alter client and server scripts of Swift, so it they send and receive necessary encryption information and choose encryption ways flexibly.
